                    <p> Modern art also known as Abstract Art eschew realism altogether. Whatever the subject in the painting, it may not
                         be accurately represented at all in the artwork. Objects may be represented by a colour or a shape 
                         instead, with the interpretation left up to the viewer. The impact of an abstract painting cannot 
                         be understated, with many using shocking displays of colour and form to dizzy the senses.</p>

                    <h3>Realism<br>(Basic/Intermediate/Expert)</h3>
                    <p>Realism
                        Realism is a painting art style that aims to give the viewer a reflection of the real world.
                         Many of the most famous paintings are painted in this style and for many, paintings made in
                        this style are what they will think of when they think of ‘art’. It is important, however,
                        to make the distinction between realism and photorealism – the former concerns itself with
                         a realistic scene but does not aim to be a true depiction. </p>

                    <h3>Expressionism<br>(Basic/Intermediate/Expert)</h3>
                    <p>At the other end of the spectrum is expressionism. Expressionism is a style of art that doesn’t
                     concern itself with realism, images and scenes are often distorted or painted with otherworldly, 
                     vivid colours that don’t match up with reality. The focus is instead on the artist’s ideas or feelings, 
                     which are expressed through the medium of art. </p>
